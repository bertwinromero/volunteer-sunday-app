## Setup Instructions

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

   ```
   EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
   EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
   EXPO_PUBLIC_PROJECT_ID=your_expo_project_id
   ```

### 4. Enable Supabase Realtime

1. In your Supabase dashboard, go to Database → Replication
2. Enable replication for these tables:
   - `profiles`

   - `program_items`
   - `tasks`

### 5. Run the App

# Run tests (when implemented)
npm test
```

## Deployment

### Building for Production

```bash
# Build for iOS
npm run build:ios

# Build for Android
npm run build:android
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Supabase URL is undefined"**
   - Make sure you've created a `.env` file and added your Supabase credentials

2. **"Auth session not persisting"**
   - Check that `expo-secure-store` is properly installed
   - Clear app data and reinstall

3. **"Realtime not working"**
   - Ensure you've enabled replication for all tables in Supabase dashboard
   - Check that RLS policies allow reading the data
